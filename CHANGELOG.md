# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (October 2, 2020)

> A whole big-chicken update! Package has been out of shape for a while, so this is a complete rewrite. You can expect all searchers to work nicely now, which is partially because I baleeted the old ones that were deprecated or broken. New CLI interface too, so... Don't use old commands, I guess.
