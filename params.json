  "body": "# booksnake\r\n\r\nBooksnake is a tool to search the web for ebooks and automagically send them to your Kindle (or email), all as simply as possible.\r\n\r\n> NOTE: Please only use booksnake for legal download of public-domain resources!\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nSpin up your favorite terminal, and boop this puppy right up in there:\r\n```shell\r\npip install booksnake\r\n```\r\n\r\nQ.E.D. wut up\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\nThis step is entirely optional, but if you don't want to have to specify `--to_email`, `--from_email`, and then type your email password every time you send, then you can add the following to a `~/.booksnakerc`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"from_email\": \"you@gmail.com\",\r\n    \"smtp_password\": \"your gmail password\",\r\n    \"to_email\": \"you@free.kindle.com\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't feel comfortable leaving your password in plaintext in your home directory (and I can't _possibly_ imagine why that would be!), you can omit that keyvalue pair and enter it at runtime.\r\n\r\nYou may also choose, like I did, to make a standalone gmail for just this purpose, and then the password is a moot point.\r\n\r\n**Make sure that regardless of which email you use, you have added it to your [Authorized Senders](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201974240) in Amazon's Kindle settings, or else Amazon will refuse to send your documents to your device.**\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Searching for, downloading, and sending a book\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nbooksnake --query \"Moby Dick\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/esbwna82m297lbwhhvm2w95ne.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/esbwna82m297lbwhhvm2w95ne)\r\n\r\n### Sending a book from a known URL\r\n```shell\r\nbooksnake --url \"http://mobydick.com/mobydick.mobi\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Sending a book from a local file:\r\n```shell\r\nbooksnake --file \"~/books/mobydick.mobi\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Advanced Usage\r\n\r\n### Converting Files\r\nIf you're a _hacking wizard_ and you have Amazon's [`kindlegen`](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211) installed, you may be able to convert some subset of epubs and pdfs to mobi, and send those to your kindle as well. As long as `kindlegen` is callable globally (e.g. you've put it in `/usr/bin` or somesuch), there's no difference in how you call booksnake:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nbooksnake --file \"~/books/mobydick.epub\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Preventing Sends, or Keeping Files\r\nIf you want to prevent booksnake from deleting the files after downloading and sending, you can pass the `--keep` flag:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nbooksnake --keep --query \"Great Expectations\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can combine this with `--no-send` if you want to _only_ download and convert the file, and not send it:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nbooksnake --keep --no-send --query \"Great Expectations\"\r\n```\r\n",
