  "body": "# booksnake\r\nA command-line tool to download, convert, and send eBooks to your kindle from the web as simply as possible, in html, pdf, epub, or mobi formats.\r\n\r\nPull requests and bug reports welcome!\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\n\r\n- Only tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and OS X.\r\n- Gmail account (do you know your password?)\r\n- `kindlegen`, a cli epub-to-mobi converter from Amazon. (Download [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211).) Must be globally callable, so I moved my executable to `/bin/`: `cp ~/Downloads/kindlegen /bin/`\r\n- `aria2` will be used for downloading files in a future release.\r\n- `smtplib`, `mimetypes`, `email`, `BeautifulSoup`, `libgenapi`. pip install them all!\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\n\r\nFirst, create a `~/.booksnakerc` file (not necessary, but makes it so you don't have to specify `--from-email`, `--to-email`, and SMTP password every time). This is JSON:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"from_email\": \"you@gmail.com\",\r\n    \"smtp_password\": \"your gmail password\",\r\n    \"to_email\": \"you@free.kindle.com\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't feel comfortable putting any of these values in plaintext in your config file, then just omit that line. `--from-email` and `--to-email` can be specified when you call `booksnake`, and if you omit the SMTP password, booksnake will prompt you for it once it's time to send your file.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n- Search online using the LibGen platform (only for freely available, public-domain books):\r\n    ```\r\n    booksnake --query \"My Title\"\r\n    ```\r\n    [![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/2ji7kxe7840xqiyujxtjyrkkg.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/2ji7kxe7840xqiyujxtjyrkkg)\r\n\r\n- Download a book from a URL:\r\n    ```\r\n    booksnake --url \"http://my.books.com/title.mobi\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Send a local file:\r\n    ```\r\n    booksnake --file \"title.mobi\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n\r\n- Magnet links\r\n- Intelligently guess what format has been downloaded (deprecate the `-f` flag)\r\n- Ping the Goodreads API to add your brand new book to a specific shelf (`--goodreads-shelf \"on-kindle\"` or something)\r\n",
